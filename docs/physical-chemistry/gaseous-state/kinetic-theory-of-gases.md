## Postulates of Kinetic Theory of Gases

1. A gas consists of a large number of very small tiny particles, which are identified as molecules. The molecules of a given gas are completely identical in size, shape and mass.
2. The volume occupied by the molecules is negligible in comparison to the volume of the gas.
3. The molecules are in rapid motion, which is completely random. During their motion, they collide with the sides of the vessel. The collisions are perfectly elastic in nature.
4. The laws of classical mechanics are applicable to the molecules in motion.
5. There is no force of attraction or repulsion amongst the molecules, i.e., they are moving independent of each other.
6. At any given instant, a molecule can have energy ranging from a small value to a large value, but the average kinetic energy is proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas.

    This also means that at fixed temperature, average kinetic energy of gas molecule is fixed.

    * Kinetic Theory of gases is applicable only for ideal gases.

    * All the gas laws can be derived from Kinetic Theory of gases.
