## Law of Mass Action

* According to this law, the rate of a reactions is directly proportional to the product of active masses of reactants raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients.

!!! example "Example"

    Let us consider a reaction:

    $$n_1A + n_2B &rarr; Products$$

    According to law of mass action, we can write:

    $$rate &Proportional; [A]^{n_1}\ [B]^{n_2}$$

    $$rate = {k\ [A]^{n_1}\ [B]^{n_2}}$$

    Here, k = rate constant and the above expression is called rate law or rate equation.

## Active Mass

* Active mass of a component A is denoted by [A].
* Active mass can be defined in two phases: solution phase and gaseous phase.
* When reaction occurs in solution phase, active mass is taken as molarity.

!!! tip ""

    $$Active\ mass = molarity$$

When reaction occurs in gaseous phase, active mass can be taken as partial pressure.

!!! tip ""

    $$Active\ mass = Partial\ pressure$$

    Since, partial pressure = mole fraction x Total pressure

    We can write:

    $$Active\ mass = Mole\ fraction \times Total\ pressure$$

* For gaseous reactants, both molarity and partial pressure can be used as active mass interchangeably.
* Active mass of solid substance in a chemical reaction is always taken as 1.

!!! example "Example"

    $$A_{(aq)} + B_{(s)} &#8652; C_{(aq)}$$

    $$[B] = 1$$

* If any one of the substance in reactant or product is solid or aqueous, then the active mass of other liquids will be taken as 1.

!!! example "Example"

    $$A_{(l)} + B{(aq)} &#8652; C_{(l)} + D_{(l)}$$

    $$[A] = 1, [C] = 1, [D] = 1$$

* For a homogeneous liquid phase reaction, the active mass of pure liquid will not be taken as unity.

!!! example "Example"

    $$A_{(l)} + B_{(l)} &#8652; C_{(l)} + D_{(l)}$$

    $$[A] &ne; 1, [B] &ne; 1, [C] &ne; 1, [D] &ne; 1$$
