## Reaction Quotient (Q<sub>c</sub>)

* Reaction quotient helps in predicting the direction of reaction. It helps to decide whether the reaction is moving in forward direction or in backward direction.
* Q<sub>c</sub> has a tendency to become equal to K<sub>c</sub>.

Let us consider a chemical reaction:

$$n_1A + n_2B &#8652; n_3C + n_4D$$

At any time t, we can define reaction quotient as:

$$Q_c = {[C]^{n_3} [D]^{n4} \over [A]^{n_1} [B]^{n_2}}$$

!!! tip "Case 1: If Q<sub>c</sub> > K<sub>c</sub>"

    Q<sub>c</sub> tends to become equal to K<sub>c</sub>. For this, its value should decrease. Hence, the concentration of C and D will decrease and that of A and B will increase.

    This indicates that reaction will shift in backward direction.

!!! tip "Case 2: If Q<sub>c</sub> < K<sub>c</sub>"

    Q<sub>c</sub> tends to become equal to K<sub>c</sub>. For this, its value should increase. Hence, the concentration of C and D will increase and that of A and B will decrease.

    This indicates that reaction will shift in forward direction.

!!! tip "Case 3: If Q<sub>c</sub> = K<sub>c</sub>"

    Reaction has already reached equilibrium.

## Question

??? question "At 1400 K, K<sub>c</sub> = 2.5 x 10<sup>-3</sup> for the reaction: <br> CH<sub>4(g)</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>g</sub> &#8652; CS<sub>2(g)</sub> + 4H<sub>2(g)</sub><br>A 10 L reaction vessel at 1400 K contains 2 moles of CH<sub>4</sub>, 3 moles of CS<sub>2</sub>, 3 moles of H<sub>2</sub> and 4 moles of H<sub>2</sub>S. Is the reaction mixture at equilibrium? If not, in which direction does the reaction proceed to reach equilibrium?"

    $$Q_c = {[CS_2][H_2]^4 \over [CH_4][H_2S]^2}$$

    $$Q_c = {({3 \over 10}) \times ({3 \over 10})^4 \over ({2\over 5})\times ({4\over 10})^2} = 7.5 \times 10^{-2}$$

    Here Q<sub>c</sub> > K<sub>c</sub>. Hence, the reaction will proceed in backward direction to achieve equilibrium.
