## EMF of a Cell

* EMF stands for Electromotive Force.

* EMF is the potential difference between the electrodes when the cell is not in use.

* When the switch is OFF in the circuit:

!!! tip ""

    $$EMF = V_{cathode} - V_{anode}$$

* It is also defined as the maximum voltage which a cell can supply.

* EMF is the voltage which is responsible for the motion of electrons in the external circuit.

## Calculation of EMF of a cell (E<sub>cell</sub>)

* EMF of a cell is given by:

!!! tip ""

    $$E_{cell} = E_{cathode} - E_{anode}$$

    Use Reduction Potential values in this formula.

* We can also calculate E<sub>cell</sub> as:

!!! tip ""

    $$E_{cell} = E_{ox} + E_{red}$$

* Standard EMF of a cell is given by:

!!! tip ""

    $$E^0_{cell} = E^0_{cathode} - E^0_{anode}$$

    Use Standard Reduction Potential values in this formula.

* We can also calculate E<sup>0</sup><sub>cell</sub> as:

!!! tip ""

    $$E^0_{cell} = E^0_{ox} + E^0_{red}$$

## Relation between Gibbs Free Energy and E<sub>cell</sub>

* The relation between Gibbs Free Energy and E<sub>cell</sub> can be expressed using the below expression:

!!! tip ""

    $$&Delta;G = -nFE_{cell}$$

!!! tip "Case 1. If the cell reaction is spontaneous"

    $$&Delta;G < 0$$

    $$-nFE_{cell} < 0$$

    $$E_{cell} > 0$$

    Thus, for a cell reaction to be spontaneous, E<sub>cell</sub> should be positive.

!!! tip "Case 2. If the cell reaction is non-spontaneous"

    $$&Delta;G > 0$$

    $$-nFE_{cell} > 0$$

    $$E_{cell} < 0$$

    Thus, for a cell reaction to be non-spontaneous, E<sub>cell</sub> should be negative.

!!! tip "Case 3. If the cell reaction is in equilibrium"

    $$&Delta;G = 0$$

    $$-nFE_{cell} = 0$$

    $$E_{cell} = 0$$

## Representation of a Galvanic Cell

#### Rules to represent a galvanic cell

* Left half of the cell should represent anode, where oxidation takes place.
* Right half of the cell should represent cathode, where reduction takes place.
* Left half and right half should be separated by the symbol of salt bridge (||).
* If an inert electrode is used, it should be written in left side before anode separated by comma.

!!! question "Represent a Daniell Cell with the following half cell reactions and Pt is used as an inert electrode"

    $$ Anode:\ Zn_{(s)} &rarr; Zn^{(2+)}_{(aq)} + 2e^- $$

    $$ Cathode:\ Cu^{(2+)}_{(aq)} + 2e^- &rarr; Cu_{(s)} $$

    This cell can be represented by applying the above rules:

    $$Pt_{(s)},\ Zn_{(s)}/{Zn^{2+}_{(C_1 M)}}\ || Cu^{2+}_{(C_2 M)}/Cu_{(s)}$$

    Pt is the inert electrode, left part represent anode and right part represent cathode. "||" represents salt bridge which separates anode and cathode.
