## Battery

Any battery or cell that we use as a source of electrical energy is basically a galvanic cell where the chemical energy is converted into electrical energy.

There are two types of batteries:

* Primary batteries
* Secondary batteries

## Primary Batteries

In primary batteries, the reaction occurs only once and after use over a period of time, battery becomes dead and cannot be used again.

Examples of primary batteries are:

* Dry cell or Leclanche cell
* Mercury cell

### Dry cell or Leclanche cell

* It consists of zinc container that also acts as anode and the cathode is a carbon (graphite) road surrounded by powdered manganese dioxide and carbon.

* The space between the electrodes is filled by a moist paste of ammonium chloride (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) and zinc chloride (ZnCl<sub>2</sub>). The electrode reactions are complex but they can be written approximately as:

!!! tip ""

    $$Anode:\ Zn_{(s)} &rarr; Zn^{2+} + 2e^-$$

    $$Cathode:\ MnO_2 + NH_4^+ + e^- &rarr; MnO(OH) + NH_3$$

* In the reaction at cathode, manganese is reduced from +4 oxidation state to +3 oxidation state.

* Ammonia produced in the reaction forms a complex with Zn<sup>2+</sup> to give [Zn(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>4+</sup>.

* The cell has a potential of nearly 1.5 V.

### Mercury Cell

* Mercury cell, suitable for low current devices like hearing aids, watched etc consists of zinc in mercury amalgam as anode and a paste of HgO and carbon as cathode.

* The electrolyte is a paste of KOH and ZnO. The electrode reactions for the cell are given below:

!!! tip ""

    $$Anode:\ Zn(Hg) + 2OH^- &rarr; ZnO + H_2O + 2e^-$$

    $$Cathode:\ HgO + H_2O + 2e^- &rarr; Hg_{(l)} + 2OH^-$$

* The overall reaction is represented by:

$$Zn(Hg) + HgO_{(s)} &rarr; ZnO_{(s)} + Hg_{(l)}$$

* The cell potential is approximately 1.35 V and remains constant during its life as the overall reaction does not involve any ion in solution whose concentration can change during its lifetime.

## Secondary Batteries

A secondary cell after use can be recharged by passing current through it in the opposite direction so that it can be used again.

Examples of secondary batteries are:

* Lead storage battery
* Nickel-Cadmium cell

### Lead storage battery

* It consists of a lead anode and a grid of lead packed with lead dioxide (PbO<sub>2</sub>) as cathode.

* A 38% solution of sulphuric acid is used as an electrolyte.

* The cell reactions are given as:

!!! tip ""

    $$Anode:\ Pb_{(s)} + {SO_4^{2-}}_{(aq)} &rarr; PbSO_{4(s)} + 2e^-$$

    $$Cathode:\ PbO_{2(s)} + {SO_4^{2-}}_{(aq)} + 4H^+_{(aq)} + 2e^- &rarr; PbSO_{4(s)} + 2H_2O_{(l)}$$

* The overall cell reaction is given by:

!!! tip ""

    $$Pb_{(s)} + PbO_{2(s)} + 2H_2SO_{4(aq)} &rarr; 2PbSO_4{(s)} + 2H_2O_{(l)}$$

* On charging the battery, the reaction is reversed and PbSO<sub>4</sub> on anode and cathode is converted into Pb and PbO<sub>2</sub> respectively.

### Nickel-Cadmium cell

* It has longer life than the lead storage battery but it is more expensive to manufacture.

* The overall reaction during discharge is:

!!! tip ""

    $$Cd_{(s)} + 2Ni(OH)_{3(s)} &rarr; CdO_{(s)} + 2Ni(OH)_{2(s)} + H_2O_{(l)}$$

## Fuel Cells

Galvanic cells that are designed to convert the energy of combustion of fuels like hydrogen, methane, methanol etc directly into electrical energy are called fuel cells.</p>

### Fuel cell using H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> produces electricity

* In this cell, hydrogen and oxygen are bubbled through porous carbon electrodes into concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide solution.

* Catalysts like finely divided platinum or palladium metal are incorporated into the electrodes for increasing the rate of electrode reactions.

* The cathode and anode reactions are given below:

!!! tip ""

    $$Cathode:\ O_{2(g)} + 2H_2O_{(l)} + 4e^- &rarr; 4OH^-_{(aq)}$$

    $$Anode:\ 2H_2O_{(g)} + 4OH^{-}_{(aq)} &rarr; 4H_2O_{(l)} + 4e^-$$

* The overall reaction is given by:

!!! tip ""

    $$2H_{2(g)} + O_{2(g)} &rarr; 2H_2O_{(l)}$$

### Advantages of fuel cells

* Fuel cells produce electricity with an efficiency of about 0% compared to thermal plants whose efficiency is about 40%.
* Fuel cells are pollution free.

!!! question "Suggest two materials other than hydrogen that can be used as fuels in fuel cells."

    Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH) are the two materials other than hydrogen that can be used as fuels in fuel cells.

## Corrosion

* Corrosion slowly coats the surfaces of metallic objects with oxides or other salts of the metal.
* The rusting of iron, tarnishing of silver, development of green coating on copper and bronze are some of the examples of corrosion.
* It causes enormous damage to buildings, bridges, ships and to all objects made of metal especially that of iron.
* In corrosion, a metal is oxidized by loss of electron to oxygen and formation of oxides.
* Corrosion of iron (rusting) occurs in the presence of water and air.

### Corrosion is an electrochemical phenomenon

* At a particular spot of an object made of iron, oxidation takes place and that spot behaves as anode.

!!! tip ""

    $$Anode:\ 2Fe_{(s)} &rarr; 2Fe^+_{(aq)} + 4e^-,\ E^0_{(Fe^{2+}/Fe)} = -0.44V$$

* Electrons released at anodic spot move through the metal and go to another spot on the metal and reduce oxygen in the presence of H<sup>+</sup>. This spot behaves as cathode with the reaction:

!!! tip ""

    $$Cathode:\ O_2{(g)} + 4H^+_{(aq)} + 4e^- &rarr; 2H_2O_{(l)},\ E^0_{H^+/O_2/H_2O} = 1.23V$$

* The overall reaction is:

!!! tip ""

    $$2Fe_{(s)} + O_{2((g)} + 4H^+_{(aq)} &rarr; 2Fe^+_{(aq)} + 2H_2O,\ E^0_{cell} = 1.67V$$

* The ferrous ions are further oxidized by atmospheric oxygen to ferric ions which come out as rust in the form of hydrated ferric oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.xH<sub>2</sub>O) and with further production of hydrogen ions.

### Prevention of Corrosion

* By painting and greasing.
* By coating the surface by some inert metals (Sn, Zn etc).
* By alloying.
