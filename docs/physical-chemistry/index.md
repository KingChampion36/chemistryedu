According to [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/physical-chemistry), physical chemistry is the branch of chemistry concerned with interactions and transformations of materials. Unlike other branches, it deals with the principles of physics underlying all chemical interactions (e.g., gas laws), seeking to measure, correlate, and explain the quantitative aspects of reactions.
