## Azeotropes

* Azeotropes are constant boiling mixtures, ie, these mixtures boil at constant temperature without any change in composition.
* The composition in liquid phase and vapour phase remains same for an azeotropic mixture.

## Azeotropic Mixture

* These are the liquid mixtures which cannot be separated by fractional distillation.
* There are two types of azeotropic mixtures: (a) Maximum boiling azeotropes and (b) Minimum boiling azeotropes

## Zeotropic Mixture

* These are the liquid mixtures which can be separated by distillation.
