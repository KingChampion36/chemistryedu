## Colligative Properties

* Colligative properties are the properties which depend on the number of solute particles present in the solution irrespective of nature of solute.

#### Four colligative properties:

* Relative Lowering of vapour pressure (RLVP)
* Elevation in boiling point
* Depression in freezing point
* Osmotic Pressure

## 1. Relative Lowering of vapour pressure

* When a non-volatile solute is added to a pure solvent, its vapour pressure decreases. This decrease in vapour pressure is known as lowering of vapour pressure.

!!! tip ""

    Lowering of V.P = p<sub>o</sub> - p<sub>s</sub>

    where, p<sub>o</sub> = V.P of pure solvent

    and, p<sub>s</sub> = V.P of solution

* Relative lowering of vapour pressure is defined as:

!!! tip ""

    $$RLVP = {p_o - p_s\over p_o}$$

* Since, p<sub>s</sub> = p<sub>o</sub>&Chi;<sub>solvent</sub>, therefore, we can write:

!!! tip ""

    $$RLVP = {p_o - p_o&Chi;_{solvent}\over p_o}$$

    $$RLVP = {1 - &Chi;_{solvent}}$$

    $$&Therefore;\ RLVP = &Chi;_{solute} $$

* Hence, we can conclude that:

    $$RLVP = {p_o - p_s\over p_o} = {&Chi;_{solute}}$$

!!! tip "Remember"

    Lowering of V.P is not a colligative property. Relative lowering of V.P is a colligative property.

## 2. Elevation of Boiling Point

* The boiling point of a solution is the temperature at which the vapour pressure of solution becomes equal to the atmospheric pressure or external pressure.

* Boiling point depends on external pressure. As external pressure changes, boiling point will also change.

* When a non-volatile solute is added to a solvent, then its boiling point will increase, ie, boiling point of a solution is always greater than pure solvent.

* This increase in boiling point of pure solvent is known as elevation of boiling point. If T<sub>b</sub> is the boiling point of solution and T<sup>o</sup><sub>b</sub> is the boiling point of pure solvent, then elevation of
  boiling point, &Delta;T<sub>b</sub> is given by:

!!! tip ""

    $$&Delta;T_b = T_b - T^o_b$$

* Elevation of boiling point is directly proportional to molality of solute in the solution.

!!! tip ""

    $$&Delta;T_b\ &Proportional;\ m$$

    $$&Delta;T_b = {K_b\ m}$$

    $$where, K_b = {Molal\ elevation\ constant}$$

## 3. Depression of Freezing Point

* Freezing point is the temperature at which the vapour pressure of solid becomes equal to atmospheric pressure.

* When a non-volatile solute is added to a pure solvent, its freezing point decreases. This decrease in freezing point is known as depression of freezing point.

* If T<sub>f</sub> is the freezing point of solution and T<sup>o</sup><sub>f</sub> is the freezing point of pure solvent, then:

!!! tip ""

    $$&Delta;T_f = {T^o_f - T_f}$$

* Depression of freezing point is directly proportional to molality of solute dissolved in the solution.

!!! tip ""

    $$&Delta;T_f\ &Proportional;\ m$$

    $$&Delta;T_f = {K_f\ m}$$

    $$where, K_f = {Molal\ depression\ constant}$$

## 4. Osmotic Pressure

* **Osmosis:** The spontaneous flow of solvent molecules from a dilute solution to a concentrated solution through a semi-permeable membrane is called osmosis.

* **Osmotic Pressure:** The pressure required to stop the movement of solvent molecules from a dilute solution to a concentrated solution through a semi-permeable membrane is called osmotic pressure. It is
  directly proportional to concentration of solution and is given by:

!!! tip ""

    $$&Pi; = {CRT}$$

    $$where, &Pi; = Osmotic\ Pressure$$

    $$C = concentration\ of\ solution$$

    $$R = Universal\ Gas\ Constant$$

    $$T = Temperature$$

* **Reverse Osmosis(RO):** If a pressure greater than osmotic pressure is applied, the direction of osmosis is reversed and the process is known as reverse osmosis. This principle is used by water filters.

* **Isotonic Solutions:** Two solutions having same osmotic pressure are called isotonic solutions.

* **Hypertonic Solution:** The solution having higher osmotic pressure as compared to other solution is known as hypertonic solution.

* **Hypotonic Solution:** The solution having lower osmotic pressure as compared to other solution is known as hypotonic solution.

!!! tip "Remember"

    Hypertonic solution and hypotonic solution are relative terms. A solution X may be hypertonic as compared to another solution Y but may be hypotonic for solution Z.
