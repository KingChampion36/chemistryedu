| 1     | The solutions which obey Raoult's law over the entire range of concentration are known as ideal solutions.                                                                            | When a solution does not obey Raoult's law over the entire range of concentration, then it is called non-ideal solution.                                |
| 2     | For binary solution with components A and B, A-A type and B-B type interactions are equal to A-B type interactions.                                                                   | For binary solution with components A and B, A-A type and B-B type interactions are not equal to A-B type interactions.                                 |
| 3     | The enthalpy of mixing of the pure components to form the solution is zero (&Delta;H<sub>mix</sub> = 0). It means that no heat is absorbed or evolved when the components are mixed.  | The enthalpy of mixing of the pure components to form the solution is not zero (&Delta;H<sub>mix</sub> &ne; 0), ie, it is either positive or negative.  |
| 4     | The volume of mixing is also zero (&Delta;V<sub>mix</sub> = 0). It means the volume of solution would be equal to the sum of volumes of the two components.                           | The volume of mixing is not zero (&Delta;V<sub>mix</sub> &ne; 0), ie, it is either positive or negative.                                                |

## Types of non-ideal solution

Non-ideal solutions can be further classified into two types: non-ideal solution with positive deviation and non-ideal solution with negative deviation.

| 1    | For binary solution, p > p<sup>o</sup><sub>A</sub>&Chi;<sub>A</sub> + p<sup>o</sup><sub>B</sub>&Chi;<sub>B</sub></td>       | For binary solution, p < p<sup>o</sup><sub>A</sub>&Chi;<sub>A</sub> + p<sup>o</sup><sub>B</sub>&Chi;<sub>B</sub></td>    |
| 2    | For binary solution with components A and B, A-A type and B-B type interactions are stronger than A-B type interactions.    | For binary solution with components A and B, A-A type and B-B type interactions are weaker than A-B type interactions.   |
| 3    | &Delta;H<sub>mix</sub> > 0. It means that heat is absorbed when the components are mixed.                                   | &Delta;H<sub>mix</sub> < 0. It means that heat is evolved when the components are mixed.                                 |
| 4    | &Delta;V<sub>mix</sub> > 0. It means the volume of solution would be greater than the sum of volumes of the two components. | &Delta;V<sub>mix</sub> < 0. It means the volume of solution would be less than the sum of volumes of the two components. |
