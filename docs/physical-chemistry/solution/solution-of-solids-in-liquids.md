## Solution of Solids in Liquid

* For non-volatile solute, partial pressure of solution is equal to partial pressure of solvent in vapour phase.

* Thus, from Raoult's law, we can write:

!!! tip ""

    $$p_s = {p^o_{solvent}\ &Chi;_{solvent}}$$

* Since &Chi;<sub>solvent</sub> is less than 1, the vapour pressure of a solution containing a non-volatile solute is always less than the vapour pressure of pure solvent.

## Factors affecting solubility of a solid solute in a liquid

1. **Nature of solute:**
     * Electrolytes are more soluble while non-electrolytes are less soluble.

2. **Nature of solvent:**
     * "Like dissolves like". Polar solvent dissolves polar solute and non-polar solvent dissolves non-polar solute.

3. **Temperature:**
     * The solubility of solid solutes in a liquid depends on temperature and can be described on the basis of type of dissolution.
     * For exothermic dissolution(Heat is released), solubility decreases on increasing temperature.
     * For endothermic dissolution(Heat is absorbed), solubility increases on increasing temperature.
