## Solution

* Solutions are homogeneous mixtures of two or more components, i.e, the composition and properties of all the components are uniform throughout the mixture.
* Single phase containing two or more components is called solution.
* Solution consists of a solvent and one or more solutes.
* Generally, the component which has same phase as that of a solution and is present in larger amount is known as solvent.
* Generally, the component which is present in smaller amount is known as solute.
* Examples: Solution of H<sub>2</sub>O + NaCl, Air (Mixture of different gases), Blood (mixture of water, oxygen, haemoglobin etc.).
