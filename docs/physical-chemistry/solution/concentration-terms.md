## Concentration Terms

* Concentration Terms are used to express the amount of solute dissolved in a solvent.
* There are different concentration terms like mass percentage, volume percentage, mass by volume percentage, parts per million, molarity, molality, mole fraction
* We will discuss each one of them in detail.

## Mass Percentage(w/w)

!!! tip "Mass percentage of a component of a solution is defined as:"

    $$w/w = {Mass\ of\ component \times 100 \over Total\ mass\ of\ solution}$$

??? question "If 10 gram sugar is present in 90 gram water, find its mass percentage."

    Here, the mass of solution is (10+90) grams = 100 grams.

    $$w/w = {Mass\ of\ component \times 100 \over Total\ mass\ of\ solution}$$

    $$= {10 \times 100 \over 100}$$

    $$= {10}$$

## Volume Percentage(v/v)

!!! tip "Volume percentage of a component of a solution is defined as:"

    $$v/v = {Volume\ of\ component \times 100 \over Total\ volume\ of\ solution}$$

??? question "If 10 ml sugar is present in 90 ml water, find its volume percentage."

    Here, the volume of solution is (10+90) ml = 100 ml.

    $$v/v = {Volume\ of\ component \times 100 \over Total\ volume\ of\ solution}$$

    $$= {10 \times 100 \over 100}$$

    $$= {10}$$

## Mass by Volume Percentage(w/v)

!!! tip "Mass by volume percentage of a component of a solution is defined as:"

    $$w/v = {Mass\ of\ component \times 100 \over Total\ volume\ of\ solution}$$

??? question "If 10 grams sugar is present in 100 ml solution, find its volume percentage."

    Here, the volume of solution is = 100 ml.

    $$w/v = {Mass\ of\ component \times 100 \over Total\ volume\ of\ solution}$$

    $$= {10 \times 100 \over 100}$$

    $$= {10}$$

## Parts per million(ppm)

* When solute is present in very small amount, we express its concentration in terms of parts per million.

!!! tip "ppm is calculated using the following formula:"

    $$ppm = {n \times 10^6 \over N}$$

    where, n = Number of parts of component

    and, N = Number of parts of all components of solution

* Parts per million can be expressed as mass to mass, volume to volume and mass to volume.

## Parts per billion (ppb)

!!! tip "parts per billion(ppb) is defined as: "

    $$ppb = {n \times 10^9 \over N}$$

    where, n = Number of parts of component

    and, N = Number of parts of all components of solution

* Similar to ppm, parts per billion(ppb) is also used when solute is in a very small amount.

## Mole Fraction (&Chi;)

* For a solution consisting of A as solute and B as solvent, we define mole fraction of A present in the solution as:

!!! tip ""

    $$&Chi;_A = {n_A \over n_A + n_B}$$

    where, <em>n<sub>A</sub></em> = Moles of A

    and, <em>n<sub>B</sub></em> = Moles of B

* Similarly, mole fraction of B in the solution is defined as:

!!! tip ""

    $$&Chi;_B = {n_B \over n_A + n_B}$$

* Here, we can see that:

!!! tip ""

    $$&Chi;_A + &Chi;_B = 1$$

* Similarly, for a solution containing k components, we can write:

!!! tip ""

    $$&Chi;_1 = {n_1 \over n_1 + n_2 + n_3 +\ ..... +\ n_k}$$

    $$&Chi;_2 = {n_2 \over n_1 + n_2 + n_3 +\ ..... +\ n_k}$$

    $$&Chi;_3 = {n_3 \over n_1 + n_2 + n_3 +\ ..... +\ n_k}$$

    Similarly,

    $$&Chi;_k = {n_k \over n_1 + n_2 + n_3 +\ ..... +\ n_k}$$

    And,

    $$&Chi;_1 + &Chi;_2 + &Chi;_3 +\ ......\ + &Chi;_k = 1$$

## Molarity(M)

* Molarity is defined as number of moles of solute present in one litre of solution.

!!! tip ""

    $$M = {n_{solute} \over V_{solution} (L)}$$

* Since molarity is dependent on volume, it changes with change in temperature.

## Molality(m)

* Molality is defined as number of moles of solute present in one kilogram of solvent.

!!! tip ""

    $$m = {n_{solute} \over mass_{solvent} (Kg)}$$

* Molality does not change with change in temperature.
