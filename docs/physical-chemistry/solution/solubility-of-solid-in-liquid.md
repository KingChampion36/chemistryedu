## Solubility

* Solubility of a substance can be defined as its maximum amount that can be dissolved in a specified amount of solvent at a specified temperature.
* There are many factors affecting solubility of a substance like pressure, temperature and nature of solute and solvent.

## Solubility of Solid in Liquid

* All solids are not soluble in a given liquid.
* When a solid is added to the solvent, some solute dissolves and its concentration increases in the solution. This process is known as dissolution.
* Some solute particles in solution collide with the solid solute particles and get separated out od solution. This process is known as crystallization.
* At equilibrium, rate of crystallization is equal to rate of dissolution. Under such condition, no more solute can be dissolved in the given solvent at same temperature. This type of solution is known as saturated solution.

    $$Solute + Solvent &#8651; Solution$$

* The solution in which more solute can be added in the solvent without changing temperature is known as unsaturated solution.
