## Ideal Gas Equation

Number of moles of an ideal gas can be calculated by ideal gas equation:

!!! tip ""

    $PV = nRT$
    <hr>
    Here, P = Pressure<br>
    V = Volume<br>
    R = Universal Gas Constant<br>
    T = Temperature in Kelvin<br>
    n = Number of moles

## Units of Pressure

* It should be remembered that the S.I. unit of pressure is Pascal (Pa).

!!! tip "Remember"

    * $1\ atm = 10^5\ Pa$
    * $1\ atm = 10^5\ N/m^2$
    * $1\ atm = 76\ cm\ of\ Hg_{(l)}$
    * $1\ atm = 760\ mm\ of\ Hg_{(l)}$
    * $1\ atm = 760\ torr$
    * $1\ atm &approx; 1\ bar$

## Values of R in different units

!!! tip "Remember"

    * $R = 0.0821\ L\ atm\ mol^{-1}K^{-1}$
    * $R = 8.314\ J\ mol^{-1}K^{-1}$
    * $R = 2\ calorie\ mol^{-1}K^{-1}$

!!! note "Note"

    * $1\ calorie = 4.186\ Joules$

## Units of Volume

* It should be remembered that the S.I unit of volume is m<sup>3</sup>.

!!! tip "Remember"

    * $1\ cm^3 = 1\ mL$
    * $1\ L = 10^3\ cm^3$
    * $1\ L = 10^{-3}\ m^3$

## Volume Occupied by one mole of an Ideal Gas at STP

* STP stands for Standard Temperature and Pressure.
* At STP, temperature is 273 K and pressure is 1 atm.
* Using ideal gas equation, let us calculate the volume of one mole ideal gas at STP:

!!! tip ""

    $$PV = nRT$$

    $$V = {nRT \over P}$$

    $$V = {{1 \times 0.0821 \times 273} \over {1}}$$

    $$V = 22.4 L$$

* Hence, one mole of any ideal gas(NH<sub>3</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>) will occupy 22.4 L at STP.

## Questions

??? question "An ideal nitrogen gas is kept in a container of 10 litres under 1.5 atm pressure at 300 K. Calculate (a) number of moles of nitrogen gas (b) mass of nitrogen gas. Molecular mass of nitrogen = 28 u."

    (a) The number of moles of ideal nitrogen gas can be calculated by ideal gas equation:

    $$PV = nRT$$

    $$1.5 \times 10 = n \times 0.0821 \times 300$$

    $$n = {{1.5 \times 10} \over {0.0821 \times 300}}$$

    $$n = {500 \over 821}$$

    (b) The mass of nitrogen can be calculated by:

    $$Mass = Number\ of\ moles \times molecular\ mass$$

    $$Mass\ of\ N_2\ gas = {500 \over 821} \times 28\ grams$$

    $$Mass\ of\ N_2\ gas = {1400 \over 821}\ grams$$

??? question "Calculate in 5.6 L ideal N<sub>2</sub> gas at STP, (a) number of moles (b) mass."

    (a) The number of moles of ideal nitrogen gas can be calculated by:

    $$Moles = {5.6 \over 22.4}$$

    $$Moles = 0.25\ L$$

    (b) The mass of nitrogen can be calculated by:

    $$Mass = Number\ of\ moles \times molecular\ mass$$

    $$Mass\ of\ N_2\ gas = 0.25 \times 28\ grams$$

    $$Mass\ of\ N_2\ gas = 7\ grams$$
