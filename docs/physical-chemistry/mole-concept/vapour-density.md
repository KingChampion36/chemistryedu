## Vapour Density

* Density of a gas relative to hydrogen is called its vapour density. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

!!! tip ""

    $$Vapour\ Density = {&rho;_{gas} \over &rho;_{H_2}}$$

* Let us consider that in a container of capacity 'V' litres, we have 'n' moles of H<sub>2</sub> gas and in another container of capacity 'V' litres, we have 'n' moles of a gas of molecular mass 'M'.

* Then, the density of H<sub>2</sub> gas is given by:

!!! tip ""

    $$&rho;_{H_2} = {Mass \over Volume}$$

    $$&rho;_{H_2} = {n \times 2 \over V}$$

* And, the density of the gas of molecular mass 'M' is given by:

!!! tip ""

    $$&rho;_{gas} = {Mass \over Volume}$$

    $$&rho;_{gas} = {n \times M \over V}$$

* Calculating vapour density of the gas of molecular mass 'M':

!!! tip ""

    $$Vapour\ Density = {&rho;_{gas} \over &rho;_{H_2}}$$

    $$Vapour\ Density = {{n \times M \over V} \over {n \times 2 \over V}}$$

    $$&Therefore; Vapour\ Density = {M \over 2}$$

* Vapour Density has no unit. It is a dimensionless quantity.

## Relative Density of a gas w.r.t another gas

* Let us consider that we have two gases, gas1 and gas2 of molecular masses M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>2</sub> respectively.. Then, the relative density of gas1 w.r.t gas2 is given by:

!!! tip ""

    $$Relative\ density\ of\ gas1\ w.r.t\ gas2 = {M_1 \over M_2}$$

!!! example "Examples"

    * $$Relative\ density\ of\ gas\ of\ molecular\ mass\ M\ w.r.t\ O_2 = {M \over 32}$$
    * $$Relative\ density\ of\ gas\ of\ molecular\ mass\ M\ w.r.t\ N_2 = {M \over 28}$$

## Relative Density of a gas w.r.t air

!!! tip ""

    $$Relative\ density\ of\ gas\ of\ molecular\ mass\ M\ w.r.t\ air = {M \over M_{air}}$$

    Here, M<sub>air</sub> = Average molecular mass of air

* Air consists of approximately 20% oxygen and 80% nitrogen. So, calculating average molecular mass of air:

!!! tip ""

    $$Avg.\ molecular\ mass\ of\ air = {(20 \times 32) + (80 \times 28) \over (20 + 80)}$$

    $$&Therefore; Avg.\ molecular\ mass\ of\ air &approx; 29\ a.m.u$$

* Therefore, we can write:

!!! tip ""

    $$Relative\ density\ of\ gas\ of\ molecular\ mass\ M\ w.r.t\ air = {M \over 29}$$

## Question

??? question "Density of a gas relative to air is 1.17. Find the molecular mass of the gas. [M<sub>air</sub> = 29 g/mole]"

    $$Relative\ density\ of\ gas\ of\ molecular\ mass\ M\ w.r.t\ air = {M \over M_{air}}$$

    $$1.17 = {M \over 29}$$

    $$M = 33.95 &approx; 34\ g/mole$$
