## Limiting Reagent

* Limiting reagent is the reactant which gets completely consumed in a chemical reaction. It limits the amount of products formed.
* Limiting reagent does not refer to the reagent present in lesser quantity. Even the reagent present in larger quantity may act like limiting reagent.

## How to identify Limiting Reagent?

* Divide the number of moles of reactants by their respective stoichiometric coefficient. The lesser value will indicate that the reactant is limiting reagent.
* After identifying limiting reagent, **make all calculations with respect to limiting reagent only**.

## Questions

??? question "For the given chemical reaction, find the mass of SO<sub>2</sub> formed: <br> S<sub>(10 g)</sub> + O<sub>2</sub><sub>(10 g)</sub> &rarr; SO<sub>2</sub>"

    $$Moles\ of\ S = {10 \over 32}$$

    $$Moles\ of\ O_2 = {10 \over 32}$$

    **Dividing these moles by corresponding stoichiometric coefficient**, we find that the values are equal for both S and O<sub>2</sub>. Hence, both are limiting reagents. Both
    S and O<sub>2</sub> will be completely consumed to form SO<sub>2</sub>.

    $$1\ mole\ of\ S\ forms\ 1\ mole\ of\ SO_2.$$

    $${10 \over 32} moles\ of\ S\ forms\ {10 \over 32} moles\ of\ SO_2.$$

    $$Mass\ of\ SO_2 = {10 \over 32} \times 64 = 20\ g$$

??? question "For the given chemical reaction, find the mass of CaCl<sub>2</sub> formed:<br> Ca<sub>(10 g)</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub><sub>(10 g)</sub> &rarr; CaCl<sub>2</sub>"

    $$Moles\ of\ Ca = {10 \over 40}$$

    $$Moles\ of\ Cl_2 = {10 \over 71}$$

    **Dividing these moles by corresponding stoichiometric coefficient**, we find that the value for both Cl<sub>2</sub> is less. Hence, Cl<sub>2</sub> is the limiting reagent.

    $$1\ mole\ of\ Cl_2\ forms\ 1\ mole\ of\ CaCl_2.$$

    $${10 \over 71} moles\ of\ Cl_2\ forms\ {10 \over 71} moles\ of\ CaCl_2.$$

    $$Mass\ of\ CaCl_2 = {10 \over 71} \times 111 = {1110 \over 71}\ g$$

??? question "For the given chemical reaction, find the mass of PCl<sub>5</sub> formed:<br>P<sub>4</sub><sub>(10 g)</sub> + 10Cl<sub>2</sub><sub>(10 g)</sub> &rarr; 4PCl<sub>5</sub>"

    $$Moles\ of\ P_4 = {10 \over 124}$$

    $$Moles\ of\ Cl_2 = {10 \over 71}$$

    **Dividing these moles by corresponding stoichiometric coefficient**, we find that the value for both Cl<sub>2</sub> is less (${{10 \over 71} \over 10} < {10 \over 124}$). Hence, Cl<sub>2</sub> is the limiting
    reagent.

    $$10\ moles\ of\ Cl_2\ form\ 4\ moles\ of\ PCl_5.$$

    $$1\ mole\ of\ Cl_2\ forms\ {4\over 10} moles\ of\ PCl_5.$$

    $${10 \over 71} moles\ of\ Cl_2\ forms\ {4 \over 10} \times {10 \over 71} moles\ of\ PCl_5.$$

    $$Mass\ of\ PCl_5 = {4 \over 10} \times {10 \over 71} \times 208.5 = {834 \over 71}\ g$$
