## Mass Percentage or Percentage by Mass

* Mass percentage represents the relative quantities of each element in a compound.
* Mass percentage of an element in the compound can be calculated by:

!!! tip ""
              
    $Mass\ Percentage = {Mass\ of\ element \times 100 \over Mass\ of\ compound}$

!!! example "Example: Let us calculate mass percentage of CaCO<sub>3</sub>"

    Please note that any amount of CaCO<sub>3</sub>, be it 1 molecule or 100 g or 1 mole or 1000 moles, will contain elements having same mass percentages.
              
    Let us take 1 mole of CaCO<sub>3</sub>.
              
    $Mass\ of\ 1\ mole\ CaCO_3 = 100\ g$
              
    Since, 1 mole CaCO<sub>3</sub> contains 1 mole Ca, 1 mole C and 3 moles O:
              
    $Mass\ of\ 1\ mole\ Ca = 40\ g$
              
    $Mass\ of\ 1\ mole\ C = 12\ g$
              
    $Mass\ of\ 3\ moles\ O = 48\ g$
              
    $Mass\ percentage\ of\ Ca = {40 \times 100 \over 100} = 40$
              
    $Mass\ percentage\ of\ C = {12 \times 100 \over 100} = 12$
              
    $Mass\ percentage\ of\ O = {48 \times 100 \over 100} = 48$

## Molecular and Empirical Formula

* Molecular formula gives the number of each atom in a single molecule of a compound whereas empirical formula gives the simplest ratio of each atom in a single molecule of the compound.
* Relation between molecular formula and empirical formula can be described as:

!!! tip ""

    $$Molecular\ formula = (Empirical\ formula)_n$$

!!! example "Example"

    Let us consider a compound whose molecular formula is C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Then, its empirical formula will be C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O.

* Mass percentage of each element in the compound will be same in both empirical and molecular formula.

## Question

??? question "An organic compound having mass percentage of C = 53.33%, mass percentage of H = 11.11%, mass percentage of O = 35.56%. Molecular weight of the organic compound is 90 g/mole. Find its empirical formula and molecular formula."

    Let 100 g of that organic compound is taken.
                  
    $Moles\ of\ C = {53.33 \over 12}$
    
    $Moles\ of\ H = {11.11 \over 1}$
    
    $Moles\ of\ O = {35.56 \over 16}$
    
    $Simplest\ ratio\ of\ moles\ of\ C,\ H,\ and\ O = {53.33 \over 12} : {11.11 \over 1} : {35.56 \over 16}$
    
    $&Therefore; Simplest\ ratio = 2:5:1$
    
    Hence, the empirical formula is C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O.
    
    Let the molecular mass of compound be (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O)<sub>n</sub>.
                  
    $$Molecular\ mass = 12 \times 2n + 1 \times 5n + 16 \times n$$
                  
    $$90 = 45n$$
    
    $$&Therefore;n = 2$$
                  
    $Hence,\ Molecular\ formula = (C_2H_5O)_n = (C_2H_5O)_2 = C_4H_{10}O_2$
