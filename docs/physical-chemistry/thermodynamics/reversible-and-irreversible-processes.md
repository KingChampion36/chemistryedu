## Irreversible Process

* An irreversible process is a type of process in which the driving force is much greater than the opposing force.

* It is a very fast process and takes a very little time to complete.

* In case of irreversible expansion, P<sub>gas</sub> is much greater than P<sub>ext</sub> (P<sub>gas</sub> >> P<sub>ext</sub>).

* In case of irreversible compression, P<sub>ext</sub> is much greater than P<sub>gas</sub> (P<sub>ext</sub> >> P<sub>gas</sub>).

* Work done in an irreversible process is given by:

    $$W_{irr} = - \int\limits_{V_1}^{V_2} P_{ext}dV$$
    
    Since, irreversible processes take place against constant external pressure.
    
    $$W_{irr} = -P_{ext}(V_2 - V_1)$$
    
    $$W_{irr} = -P_{ext}&Delta;V$$

## Reversible Process

* In a reversible process, the driving force is infinitesimally greater than the opposing force.

* If the opposing force is increased by an infinitesimally small amount, the process returns back to its previous state. Therefore, it is called reversible.

* Reversible processes are generally very slow processes.

* For a reversible expansion, P<sub>gas</sub> is infinitesimally greater than P<sub>ext</sub>.

* For a reversible compression, P<sub>ext</sub> is infinitesimally greater than P<sub>gas</sub>.

* In general, we can write: P<sub>ext</sub> &thickapprox; P<sub>gas</sub>

* Work done in a reversible process is given by:

    $$W_{rev} = - \int\limits_{V_1}^{V_2} P_{ext}dV$$
    
    Since, P<sub>ext</sub> &thickapprox; P<sub>gas</sub>, we can write:
    
    $$W_{rev} = - \int\limits_{V_1}^{V_2} P_{gas}dV$$
