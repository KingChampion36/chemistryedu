## First Law of Thermodynamics

* Whenever the state of a system changes, there will be change in its internal energy.
* This change in its internal energy can be done by two ways: (a) by doing work on the system or work is done by the system (b) by supplying heat to the system or heat is released by the system.
* This is known as First Law of Thermodynamics. It is based on energy conservation principle.
* Mathematically, we can express first law of thermodynamics as:

    $$&Delta;U = q + W$$

## Question

??? question "A gas contained in a cylinder fitted with a frictionless piston expands against a constant external pressure of 1 atm from volume 4 L to 14 L. In doing so, it absorbs 800 J from surrounding. Calculate the change in internal energy of the system."

    $$W = - \int\limits_{V_1}^{V_2} P_{ext}dV$$

    Since P<sub>ext</sub> is constant, we can write this as:

    $$W = -P_{ext} (V_2 - V_1)$$

    $$W = -1 (14 - 4)$$

    $$W = -10\ atm L $$

    $$W = -10 \times 101.3\ J\ (Since,\ 1\ atm\ L = 101.3\ J)$$

    $$W = -1013\ J$$

    Now, calculating &Delta;U from first law of thermodynamics:

    $$&Delta;U = q + W$$

    $$&Delta;U = 800\ J + (-1013)\ J$$

    $$&Delta;U = -213\ J$$

    * Please note that we have used heat absorbed by the system as +800 J in the question as per sign convention.
