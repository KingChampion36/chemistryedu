## Gibbs Free Energy (G)

* There are two types of energy in a system: (a) Entropy (Waste energy) and (b) Gibbs free energy (Useful energy).
* The energy in the system which can be converted to useful work is known as Gibbs Free energy.
* It is a state function. So, its value depends only on initial and final state of the system.
* It is an extensive property.

## Mathematical Definition of Gibbs Free Energy

* Mathematically, we can define Gibbs Free Energy, G as:

!!! tip ""

    $$G = H - TS$$

    Here, H = Enthalpy of the system <br>

    T = Temperature and S = Entropy of the system

    $$dG = dH - TdS - SdT$$

* If the process is isothermal:

!!! tip ""

    $$dG = dH - TdS$$

    Integrating both sides, we get:

    $$&Delta;G = &Delta;H - T&Delta;S$$

* This equation is also known as Gibbs Helmoltz Equation.

!!! tip "Spontaneity of a process"

    * **Case 1:** If &Delta;G < 0, process will be spontaneous.
    * **Case 2:** If &Delta;G > 0, process will be non-spontaneous.
    * **Case 3:** If &Delta;G = 0, system will be in equilibrium.

## Standard Change in Gibbs Free Energy (&Delta;G<sup>o</sup>)

Change in Gibbs Free Energy at 1 bar pressure and 298 K temperature is known as standard change in Gibbs Free Energy (&Delta;G<sup>o</sup>).

At standard conditions:

!!! tip ""

    $$&Delta;G^o = &Delta;H^o - T&Delta;S^o$$

    Here, &Delta;H<sup>o</sup> = Change in enthalpy of the system at 1 bar pressure and 298 K <br>

    and, &Delta;S<sup>o</sup> = Change in entropy of the system at 1 bar pressure and 298 K

## Change in Gibbs Free Energy for isothermal reversible process

!!! tip ""

    Mathematical definition of G is given by:

    $$G = H - TS$$

    $$dG = dH - TdS$$

    $$dG = d(U + PV) - TdS$$

    $$dG = dU + PdV + VdP - TdS$$

    At constant temperature, dU = 0.

    $$dG = PdV + VdP - TdS$$

    For an isothermal reversible process, we can write using first law of thermodynamics:

    $$dU = dq + dW$$

    $$0 = dq - PdV$$

    $$PdV = dq = TdS$$

    Putting this value of PdV in the expression of dG:

    $$dG = TdS + VdP - TdS$$

    $$dG = VdP$$

    Integrating both sides, we get:

    $$ \int\limits_{G_1}^{G_2} dG = \int\limits_{P_1}^{P_2} VdP$$

    $$ (G_2 - G_1) = \int\limits_{P_1}^{P_2}{nRT \over P}dP$$

    $$&Delta;G = nRTln{P_2 \over P_1}$$

    Since, pressure is inversely proportional to volume, we can write:

    $$&Delta;G = nRTln{V_1 \over V_2}$$

## Gibbs Free Energy and Reaction Quotient

* Mathematically, Gibbs Free Energy is related to reaction quotient by the following equation:

!!! tip ""

    $$&Delta;G = &Delta;G^o + RTlnQ_c$$

    Here, &Delta;G = Change in Gibbs Free Energy

    &Delta;G<sup>o</sup> = Change in Standard Gibbs Free Energy

    T = Temperature

    R = Universal Gas Constant

    Q<sub>c</sub> = Reaction Quotient

* At equilibrium, &Delta;G = 0 and Q = K<sub>c</sub> (equilibrium constant):

!!! tip ""

    $$0 = &Delta;G^o + RTlnK_c$$

    $$&Delta;G^o = -RTlnK_c$$

## Third Law of Thermodynamics

* The third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a solid approaches zero at absolute zero temperature (0 K).

* In other words, the entropy of a perfect crystalline substance becomes zero at absolute zero temperature (0 K).

!!! tip ""

    $$S_0 = 0$$

* The third law of thermodynamics can be used to calculate the absolute entropy of a substance at a given temperature.

!!! tip ""

    At any temperature T:

    $$&Delta;S = S_T - S_0$$

    $$&Delta;S = S_T - 0$$

    $$Or,\ S_T = &Delta;S$$

    Here, S<sub>T</sub> = entropy at temperature T
