In addition to dividing elements into s, p, d and f blocks, elements can also be divided into three categories: metals, non-metals and metalloids.

## Differences between Metals and Non-Metals

|S.No. |	Metals                                                                                                      |   Non-metals
|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|1.	   |    Metals generally lie on left side of periodic table.                                                        |	Non-metals generally lie on right side of periodic table.
|2.	   |    Generally, solid at room temperature except mercury which is liquid.                                        |   Generally, solid or gas at room temperature.
|3.	   |    Good conductors of heat and electricity.	                                                                |   Bad conductors of heat and electricity.
|4.	   |    They have high melting and boiling points except gallium and caesium which have low melting point.          |	They have low melting and boiling points with the exceptions of boron and carbon.
|5.	   |    They are malleable (can be flattened into thin sheets by hammering) and ductile (can be drawn into wires).  |	They are brittle and are neither malleable nor ductile.
|6.	   |    Metallic character increases down the group and decreases across the period.                                |	Non-metallic character decreases down the group and increases across the period.
|7.	   |    Examples: Na, Al, Ca, K	                                                                                    |   Examples: S, O, C, N, He

!!! tip "Metalloids"

    The transition from metals to non-metals on moving from left to right across the periodic table is not abrupt.
    There are some elements whose characteristics lie between metals and non-metals and are called semi-metals or metalloids.
    The examples of metalloids are silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium.

## Question

??? question "Considering the atomic number and position in the periodic table, arrange the following elements in the increasing order of metallic character : Si, Be, Mg, Na, P."

    We know that metallic character increases down the group and decreases across the period.

    So, the order of increasing metallic character is P < Si < Be < Mg < Na.
