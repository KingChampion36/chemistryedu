## Introduction

The inertness of noble gases is attributed to the following reasons:

* The noble gases have completely filled electronic configuration in their valence shell.
* They have high ionization enthalpy and more positive electron gain enthalpy.

In 1962, Neil Bartlett observed the reaction of noble gases. First he prepared a red compound which is formulated as O<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>PtF<sub>6</sub><sup>-</sup>. He, then realized that the first ionization enthalpy
of molecular oxygen was almost identical to that of Xenon. He was successful in preparing another compound Xe<sup>+</sup>PtF<sub>6</sub><sup>-</sup> by mixing PtF<sub>6</sub> and Xenon.
After this discovery, a number of xenon compounds mainly with most electronegative elements like fluorine and oxygen have been synthesized.

!!! tip "Some important points"

    * The compounds of Krypton are fewer, example: KrF<sub>2</sub>.
    * Compounds of Radon have not been isolated but only identified (Ex: RnF<sub>2</sub>) by radiotracer technique.
    * Helium is used as a diluent for oxygen in modern diving apparatus because of its very low solubility in blood.

## 1. Xenon-fluorine Compounds

* Xenon forms three binary fluorides, XeF<sub>2</sub>, XeF<sub>4</sub> and XeF<sub>6</sub> by the direct reaction of elements under appropriate experimental conditions.

* XeF<sub>6</sub> can also be prepared by the interaction of XeF<sub>4</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> at 143 K.

* Xenon-fluorine compounds are powerful fluorinating agents. They are readily hydrolyzed even by traces of water.

    $$2XeF_{2(s)} + 2H_2O_{(l)} &rarr; 2Xe_{(g)} + 4HF_{(g)} + O_{2(g)}$$

* Xenon fluorides react with fluoride ion acceptors to form cationic species and fluoride ion donors to form fluoroanions.

    $$XeF_4 + SbF_5 &rarr; [XeF_3]^+ [SbF_6]^-$$

    $$XeF_6 + MF &rarr; M^+ [XeF_7]^-$$

    $$Here,\ M = Na,\ K,\ Rb\ or Cs$$

## 2. Xenon-Oxygen Compounds

* Hydrolysis of XeF<sub>4</sub> and XeF<sub>6</sub> with water gives XeO<sub>3</sub>.

    $$XeF_6 + 3H_2O &rarr; XeO_3 + 6HF$$

* Partial hydrolysis of XeF<sub>6</sub> gives oxyfluorides, XeOF<sub>4</sub> and XeO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>.

## Questions

??? question "What inspired N. Bartlett for carrying out reaction between Xe and PtF<sub>6</sub>?"

    N. Bartlett found that the first ionization enthalpy of molecular oxygen and xenon are almost identical. He first prepared a compound O<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>PtF<sub>6</sub><sup>-</sup> and then
    successfully prepared Xe<sup>+</sup>PtF<sub>6</sub><sup>-</sup> at 278 K.

    $$Xe + PtF_6 &rarr; Xe^+PtF_6^-$$

??? question "Why is helium gas used in diving apparatus?"

    It is used in diving apparatus because of its very low solubility in blood.

??? question "Balance the reaction: XeF<sub>6</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; XeO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> + HF"

    XeF<sub>6</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; XeO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> + 4HF

??? question "Does the hydrolysis of XeF<sub>6</sub> lead to a redox reaction?"

    No, the products of hydrolysis are XeOF<sub>4</sub> and XeO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> where the oxidation states of all the elements remain same as it was in the reacting state.
