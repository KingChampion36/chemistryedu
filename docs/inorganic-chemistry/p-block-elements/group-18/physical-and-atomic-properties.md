## Introduction

* Group 18 elements contains six elements: helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon and radon.
* All these are gases and chemically unreactive and form very few compounds.
* Group 18 elements are also known as noble gases because they have completely filled valence shell orbitals and therefore react with a very few elements only under certain conditions.
* Radon is a radioactive element.

## Physical Properties of Group 18 Elements

* All the noble gases are monoatomic.
* They are colourless, odourless and tasteless.
* They are sparingly soluble in water.
* They have very low melting and boiling points because the only type of interatomic interaction in these elements is weak dispersion forces.
* Helium has an unusual property of diffusing through most commonly used laboratory materials such as rubber, glass or plastics.
* Helium is a non-inflammable and light gas. Hence, it is used in filling balloons for meteorological observations.

## Atomic Properties of Group 18 Elements

### 1. Electronic Configuration:

* All noble gases have general electronic configuration ns<sup>2</sup>np<sup>6</sup> except helium which has 1s<sup>2</sup>.
* Many of the properties of noble gases including their inactive nature are ascribed to their closed shell structures.

### 2. Ionization Enthalpy:

* The energy required to remove an electron from an isolated gaseous atom in its ground state is known as ionization enthalpy. It is depicted by &Delta;<sub>i</sub>H. It is expressed in Kilojoules per mole (KJ mol<sup>-1</sup>).
* Due to stable electronic configuration, these gases exhibit very high ionization enthalpy.
* However, ionization enthalpy decreases down the group with increase in atomic size.

### 3. Atomic Radii:

* Noble gases have large atomic size because they have Van der Waals' radii only which are expected to have higher magnitude.
* Atomic radii of group 18 elements increase down the group with increase in atomic number.

### 4. Electron Gain Enthalpy:

* When a gaseous atom in ground state gains an electron, energy is absorbed or released. This is known as electron gain enthalpy. It is represented by &Delta;<sub>eg</sub>H.
* Since noble gases have stable electronic configurations, they have no tendency to accept the electron and therefore, they have large positive values of electron gain enthalpy.

## Questions

??? question "Why has it been difficult to study the chemistry of Radon?"

    Radon is a radioactive element with a very short half life of 3.82 days. That is why, the study of chemistry of Radon is a difficult task.

??? question "Why are the elements of Group 18 known as noble gases?"

    The elements present in group 18 have their valence shell orbitals completely filled and therefore react with a very few elements only under certain conditions. Therefore, they are called noble
    gases.

??? question "Noble gases have very low boiling points. Why?"

    Noble gases being monoatomic have no interatomic forces except the weak dispersion forces and therefore, they are liquefied at very low temperatures. Hence, they have low boiling points.

??? question "Why do noble gases have large atomic sizes?"

    It is because they have Van der Waals' radii which are expected to have larger magnitude.
