## 1. Reactivity with Hydrogen:

* Group 16 elements react with hydrogen to form hydrides of the type H<sub>2</sub>E (E = O, S, Se, Te, Po).

### Properties of Hydrides:

* Their acidic character increases from H<sub>2</sub>O to H<sub>2</sub>Te due to decrease in bond enthalpy of H-E bond down the group.
* Thermal stability of hydrides decreases down H<sub>2</sub>O to H<sub>2>Po due to decrease in bond dissociation enthalpy of H<sub>2</sub>O to H<sub>2>Po.
* All the hydrides except water possess reducing property and this character increases from H<sub>2</sub>S to H<sub>2>Te.

## 2. Reactivity with Oxygen:

* All these elements form oxides of the EO<sub>2</sub> and EO<sub>3</sub> types (E = S, Se, Te, Po).

### Properties of Oxides:

* **Physical state:** Ozone(O<sub>3</sub>) and sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) are gases while selenium dioxide (SeO<sub>2</sub>) is solid.
* **Reducing property:** Reducing property of dioxide decreases from SO<sub>2</sub> to TeO<sub>2</sub>. SO<sub>2</sub> is a reducing agent while TeO<sub>2</sub> is an oxidizing agent.
* Besides EO<sub>2</sub> type, sulphur, selenium and tellurium also form EO<sub>3</sub> type oxides (SO<sub>3</sub>, SeO<sub>3</sub>, TeO<sub>3</sub>).
* **Acidic character:** Both EO<sub>2</sub> and EO<sub>3</sub> type oxides are acidic in nature.

## 3. Reactivity towards the Halogens:

* Elements of Group 16 form a large number of halides of the type: EX<sub>6</sub>, EX<sub>4</sub> and EX<sub>2</sub>, where E is an element of group 16 and X is a halogen.
* The stability of halides decreases in the order F<sup>-</sup> > Cl<sup>-</sup> > Br<sup>-</sup> > I<sup>-</sup>. Amongst hexahalides, hexafluorides are the only stable halides.
  All hexafluorides are gaseous in nature They have octahedral structure. Sulphur hexafluoride, SF<sub>6</sub>, is exceptionally stable for steric reasons.
* Amongst tetrafluorides, SF<sub>4</sub> is a gas, SeF<sub>4</sub> is a liquid and TeF<sub>4</sub> is a solid. These fluorides have sp<sup>3</sup>d hybridisation. Their geometry is Trigonal bipyramidal and shape is see-saw.

* All the elements except selenium form dichlorides and dibromides. These halides are formed by sp<sup>3</sup> hybridisation and have tetrahedral structure.
* The well known monohalides are dimeric in nature. These dimeric halides undergo disproportionation as below:

  $$2Se_2Cl_2 &rarr; SeCl_4 + 3Se$$
