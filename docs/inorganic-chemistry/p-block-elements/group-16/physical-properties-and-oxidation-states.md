## Physical Properties of Group 16 Elements

### 1. Type:

* Oxygen and sulphur are non metals.
* Selenium and tellurium are Metalloids.
* Polonium is a metal and is a radioactive element.

### 2. Melting and boiling points:

* Boiling and melting points increase with an increase in atomic number down the group.
* The large difference between the melting and boiling points of oxygen and sulphur may be explained on the basis of their atomicity: oxygen exists as diatomic molecule (O<sub>2</sub>) whereas sulphur exists as polyatomic molecule (S<sub>8</sub>).

## Oxidation states and trends in chemical reactivity

* The elements of Group 16 exhibit a number of Oxidation states.
* The stability of -2 oxidation state decreases down the group.
* Since electronegativity of oxygen is group. high, it shows only negative oxidation states -2  except in the case of OF<sub>2</sub> where it shows +2 oxidation state.
* Other elements of the group exhibit oxidation states of +2, +4 and +6.
* Sulphur (s), Selenium (se), Tellurium (Te) usually exhibit +4 oxidation state in their compounds with oxygen and +6 with fluorine.
* The stability of + 6 oxidation state decreases down the group and that of +4 oxidation state increases due to inert pair effect.
* Bonding in +4 and +6 oxidation states is primarily covalent.

## Anomalous Behaviour of Oxygen

* Oxygen shows anomalous behaviour in its group due to its small size, high electronegativity and non-availability of d-orbitals in its valence shell.
* One typical example of effects of small size and high electronegativity is the presence of strong hydrogen bonding in H<sub>2</sub>O which is not found in and H<sub>2</sub>S.
