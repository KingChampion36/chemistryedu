Group 16 elements are also known as chalcogens. The elements of group 16 are Oxygen(O), Sulphur(S), Selenium(Se), Tellurium(Te) and Polonium(Po).

## Atomic Properties of Group 16 Elements

### 1. Electronic Configuration

* General valence shell Electronic Configuration: ns<sup>2</sup>np<sup>4</sup>

### 2. Atomic and ionic radii:

* Due to increase in the number of shells, atomic and ionic radii increase from top to bottom in the group.
* The size of the oxygen atom is, however, exceptionally small.

### 3. Ionization Enthalpy:

* Ionisation enthalpy decreases down the group. This is due to increase in atomic size and increase in the number of shells.
* The elements of this group have lower ionisation enthalpy values compared to those of group 15 in the corresponding periods. This is due to the fact that group 15 elements have extra stable half filled p orbitals electronic configurations.

### 4. Electron Gain Enthalpy:

* Because of the compact nature of oxygen atom, it has less negative electron gain enthalpy than sulphur. However, from
  sulphur onwards, electron gain enthalpy becomes less negative upto Polonium.

### 5. Electronegativity:

* Oxygen is the second most electronegative element next to fluorine.
* Within the group, electronegativity decreases with an increase in atomic number. This implies that the metallic character increases from oxygen to polonium.

## Question

!!! question "Elements of group 16 generally show lower value of first ionisation enthalpy compared to the corresponding elements of group 15. Why?"

    Due to extra stable half-filled p orbitals electronic configurations of Group 15 elements, larger amount of energy energy is required to remove electrons compared to Group 16 elements.
