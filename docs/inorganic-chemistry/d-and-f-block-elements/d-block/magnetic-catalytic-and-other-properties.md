## Magnetic Properties of d-block Elements

* **Diamagnetic Substances:** Diamagnetic substances are repelled by the applied magnetic field.

* **Paramagnetic Substances:** Paramagnetic substances are weakly attracted by the applied magnetic field.

* **Ferromagnetic Substances:** Ferromagnetic substances are strongly attracted by the applied magnetic field.

* In d-block elements , paramagnetism arises due to presence of unpaired electrons, each electron having a dipole moment.

* Magnetic moment is calculated by "spin only" formula:

!!! tip ""

    $$&mu; = \sqrt{n(n+2)}$$

    where, n = Number of unpaired electrons

* The unit of spin only magnetic moment is Bohr Magneton (B.M).

## Formation of Coloured Compounds by d-block Elements

* When an electron from a lower energy d-orbital is excited to a higher energy d-orbital, the energy of excitation corresponds to the frequency of light absorbed. This frequency generally lies in the visible region.
* The colour observed corresponds to the complimentary colour of the light absorbed.
* The frequency of light absorbed is determined by the nature of ligand.

## Formation of Complex Compounds by d-block Elements

!!! tip "Complex Compounds"

    Complex compounds are those in which the metal ions bind a number of anions or neutral molecules giving complex species.

Transition elements form a large number of coordination compounds due to:

* Smaller sizes of metal ions.
* Availability of d-orbitals for bond formation.
* High ionic charges.

!!! example "Examples"

    1. ${[Fe(CN)_6]^{3-}}$
    2. $[Cu(NH_3)_4]^{2+}$

## Catalytic Properties of d-block Elements

Transition elements are effective as catalysts due to their ability to:

* adopt multiple oxidation states.
* form complexes.

| Reaction                  | 	Catalyst            |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| Contact Process	          | Vanadium(V) Oxide     |
| Haber Process	            | Finely divided iron   |
| Catalytic hydrogenation	  | Nickel                |

!!! example "Example"

    Iron(III) catalyzes reaction between iodide and persulphate ion.

    $$2I^- + S_2O_8^{2-} &rarr; I_2 + 2SO_4^{2-}$$

    **Step 1.**

    $$2Fe^{3+} + 2I^- &rarr; 2Fe^{2+} + I_2$$

    **Step 2.**

    $$2Fe^{2+} + S_2O_8^{2-} &rarr; 2Fe^{3+} + 2SO_4^{2-}$$

## Formation of Interstitial Compounds by d-block Elements

* Interstitial compounds are those which are formed when small atoms like H, C or N are trapped inside the crystal lattices of metals. They are usually non-stoichiometric and are neither typically ionic or covalent.
* **Examples:** TiC, Mn<sub>4</sub>N, Fe<sub>3</sub>H, VH<sub>0.56</sub>, TiH<sub>1.7</sub>
* Interstitial compounds are very hard and have high melting points than pure metals.
* Interstitial compounds are chemically inert and have metallic conductivity.

## Alloy Formation by d-block Elements

* An alloy is a blend of metals prepared by mixing the components.
* Alloys are formed by atoms with metallic radii that are within about 15% of each other.
* Because of similar radii and other characteristics of transition metals, alloys are readily formed by these metals. The alloys so formed are hard and have high melting points. **Example:** Stainless steel
* Alloys of transition metals with non transition metals are also made. **Example:** Brass (Copper + Zinc) and Bronze (Copper + Tin).

## Questions

??? question "Calculate the magnetic moment of a divalent ion in aqueous solution if its atomic number is 25."

    Electronic Configuration of divalent ion with Z = 25 is: 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>6</sup>3s<sup>2</sup>3p<sup>6</sup>3d<sup>5</sup>.

    Number of unpaired electrons, n = 5

    $$&mu; = \sqrt{n(n+2)}$$

    $$&mu; = \sqrt{5(5+2)} = 5.92\ BM$$

??? question "Calculate the spin only magnetic moment of M<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> ion (Z = 27)."

    Electronic configuration of M<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>: 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>6</sup>3s<sup>2</sup>3p<sup>6</sup>3d<sup>7</sup>.

    Number of unpaired electrons, n = 3

    $$&mu; = \sqrt{n(n+2)}$$

    $$&mu; = \sqrt{3(3+2)} = 3.87\ BM$$

    Hence, spin only magnetic moment obtained for the given ion is 3.87 BM.
