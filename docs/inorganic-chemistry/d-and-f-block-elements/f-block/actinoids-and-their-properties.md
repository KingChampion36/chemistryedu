description: The fourteen elements following actinium are called actinoids. Because actinium closely resembles the actinoids, it is usually included in the discussion of actinoids.

## Actinoids

* The actinoids include fourteen elements from Thorium (Th) to Lawrencium (Lr).

!!! tip "General Electronic Configuration"

    $$(n-2)f^{0-14} (n-1)d^{0-1}ns^2$$

* The irregularities in the electronic configuration of actinoids are related to stability of f<sup>0</sup>, f<sup>7</sup> and f<sup>14</sup> configuration of the 5f orbitals.
* The chemistry of actinoids is much complicated due to: (a) wide range of oxidation states (b) Radioactive property

## Atomic and Ionic Sizes

!!! tip "Actinoid Contraction"

    The gradual decrease in the size of atoms or M<sup>3+</sup> ions across the actinoid series is called actinoid contraction.

    Actinoid contraction is greater from element to element than lanthanoid contraction due to very poor shielding of 5f-electrons as compared to 4f-electrons.

## Oxidation States

* In general, actinoids show +3 oxidation state.
* However, they exhibit a very wide range of oxidation states, which makes their chemistry complicated.

## Similarities between Lanthanoids and Actinoids

* In both, f-orbitals are progressively filled.
* Both form coloured ions.
* Both are paramagnetic in nature.
* Both show contraction, ie, lanthanoid contraction and actinoid contraction.

## Differences between Lanthanoids and Actinoids

| S.No. | Lanthanoids                                                   | Actinoids                                           |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 1.    | 4-f orbital is progressively filled.                          | 5-f orbital is progressively filled.                |
| 2.    | +3 oxidation state is the most common along with +2 and +4.   | They show +2, +3, +4, +5, +6, +7 oxidation states.  |
| 3.    | Only promethium (Pm) is radioactive.                          | All are radioactive.                                |
| 4.    | They are less reactive than actinoid.                         | They are more reactive.                             |
| 5.    | The magnetic properties are less complex.                     | The magnetic properties are more complex.           |

## Applications of d and f block Elements

* Tungsten (W) is used in making electrical filaments.
* Titanium is used in nuclear reactions.
* Iron is used as a catalyst in Haber's process.

## Question

??? question "Actinoid contraction is greater from element to element than lanthanoid contraction. Why?"

    It is due to very poor shielding of 5f electrons as compared to 4f electrons.
