In this article, we will discuss some important compounds of sodium like washing soda, sodium chloride, caustic soda and baking soda.

## Washing Soda (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.10H<sub>2</sub>O)

* Sodium carbonate is a white crystalline solid which exists as a decahydrate, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.10H<sub>2</sub>O. This is known as washing soda.

* Washing soda is readily soluble in water.

* When washing soda is heated, it forms monohydrate.

!!! tip ""

    $$Na_2CO_3.10H_2O + Heat &rarr; Na_2CO_3.H_2O + 9H_2O$$

* When washing soda is heated above 373 K, it forms sodium carbonate or soda ash which is a white powder.

!!! tip ""

    $$Na_2CO_3.H_2O + Heat (> 373K) &rarr; Na_2CO_3 + H_2O$$

    $$Na_2CO_3.10H_2O + Heat (> 373K) &rarr; Na_2CO_3 + 10H_2O$$

### Preparation of Sodium Carbonate

* Sodium carbonate is prepared by solvay process.

!!! tip "Step I. Preparation of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>"

    $$2NH_3 + H_2O + CO_2 &rarr; (NH_4)_2CO_3$$

    $$(NH_4)_2CO_3 + H_2O + CO_2 &rarr; 2NH_4HCO_3$$

    $$2NH_4HCO_3 + NaCl &rarr; NH_4Cl + NaHCO_3 &darr;$$

    NaHCO<sub>3</sub> is obtained as precipitate and it is separated out.

!!! tip "Step II. Heating of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>"

    $$2NaHCO_3 + Heat &rarr; Na_2CO_3 + H_2O + CO_2$$

    In this process NH<sub>3</sub> is recovered when NH<sub>4</sub>Cl is treated with Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>.

    $$2NH_4Cl + Ca(OH)_2 &rarr; 2NH_3 + CaCl_2 + 2H_2O$$

!!! note "Note"

    It is important to note that solvay process is not used to prepare potassium carbonate because KHCO<sub>3</sub> is too soluble in water.

### Uses of washing soda

* Water softening, laundering and cleaning.
* Manufacture of glass, soap, borax and caustic soda.
* Used in paper, paints and textile industries.

## Sodium Chloride (NaCl)

* Sodium chloride is known as common salt or table salt.
* The solubility of NaCl does not increase appreciably with increase in temperature.

### Preparation of Sodium Chloride

* Crude sodium chloride is obtained by crystallization of brine solution (concentrated NaCl solution).
* Crude sodium chloride contains the following impurities: CaSO<sub>4</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Both CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub> are deliquescent, ie they absorb moisture.
* Pure sodium chloride is obtained by dissolving crude NaCl in minimum amount of water and filtered to remove insoluble impurities.
* This solution is saturated with HCl gas. Then crystals of pure NaCl are separated out.
* Ca and Mg chloride are more soluble in solution than NaCl and these remained in the solution.

### Uses of Sodium Chloride

* It is used as common salt or table salt.
* It is used to prepare Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, NaOH and Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.

## Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) or Caustic soda

* Caustic soda or sodium hydroxide is a white and translucent solid.
* It melts at 591 K.
* It is readily soluble in water and gives a strong alkaline solution.
* Crystals of NaOH are deliquescent, ie, they absorb moisture.
* Sodium hydroxide solution at the surface reacts with CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere to form Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.

!!! tip ""

    $$2NaOH + CO_2 &rarr; Na_2CO_3 + H_2O$$

### Preparation of Sodium Hydroxide

!!! tip "Step I. Electrolysis of brine solution in Castner-Kellner cell"

    In Castner-Kellner cell, mercury is cathode and carbon is anode.

    $$Cathode:\ Na^+ + e^- + Hg &rarr; Na-Hg\ (Sodium\ amalgam)$$

    $$Anode:\ Cl^- &rarr; {1 \over 2}Cl_2 + e^-$$

!!! tip "Step II. The amalgam is treated with water to give sodium hydroxide and hydrogen."

    $$2Na-Hg + 2H_2O &rarr; 2NaOH + 2Hg + H_2 &uarr;$$

### Uses of Sodium Hydroxide

* It is used as a cleansing agent and in the manufacturing of washing soda.
* It is used in the preparation of soda lime.
* It is used in the extraction of aluminium by purifying bauxite.

## Sodium Hydrogen Carbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) or Baking soda

* Sodium hydrogen carbonate is known as baking soda because it decomposes on heating to generate bubbles of CO<sub>2</sub> leaving holes in cake or pastries and making them light and fluffy.

!!! tip ""

    $$2NaHCO_3 + Heat &rarr; Na_2CO_3 + H_2O + CO_2$$

### Preparation of Sodium Hydrogen Carbonate

* It is made by saturating a solution of sodium carbonate with carbon dioxide. The white crystalline powder of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> being less soluble gets separated out.

!!! tip ""

    $$Na_2CO_3 + H_2O + CO_2 &rarr; 2NaHCO_3 &darr;$$

### Uses of Sodium Hydrogen Carbonate

* It is used as a mild antiseptic for skin infections.

* It is used in fire extinguishers because it generates CO<sub>2</sub>.

!!! tip ""

    $$2NaHCO_3 + Heat &rarr; Na_2CO_3 + H_2O + CO_2$$

* It can be used as an antacid which is used to treat stomach upset and indigestion.
