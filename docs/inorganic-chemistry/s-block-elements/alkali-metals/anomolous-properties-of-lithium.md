## Anomalous behaviour of lithium

The anomalous behaviour of lithium is due to:

* exceptionally small size of its atom and ion.
* its high polarizing power (ie, high charge/radius ratio).

## Differences between lithium and other alkali metals

| Li has higher melting and boiling points.                                                                                           | Alkali metals have low melting and boiling points.                                                                                      |
| Li is the least reactive among alkali metals.                                                                                       | Alkali metals are highly reactive.                                                                                                      |
| Li is the strongest reducing agent.                                                                                                 | Alkali metals are strong reducing agents.                                                                                               |
| Li forms mainly monoxide, Li<sub>2</sub>O.                                                                                          | Alkali metals form peroxides and superoxides.                                                                                           |
| Li reacts directly with N<sub>2</sub> to form Li<sub>3</sub>N.                                                                      | Alkali metals are unreactive towards N<sub>2</sub>.                                                                                     |
| LiCl is deliquescent and crystallizes as hydrate, LiCl.2H<sub>2</sub>0.                                                             | Other alkali metal chlorides do not form hydrates.                                                                                      |
| Lithium hydrogen carbonate is not obtained in solid form.                                                                           | Alkali metals form solid hydrogen carbonate.                                                                                            |
| Lithium does not form ethynide on reaction with ethyne.                                                                             | Alkali metals form ethynide on reaction with ethyne.                                                                                    |

| LiF and Li<sub>2</sub>O are much less soluble in water.                                                                             | Alkali metal halides and oxides are highly soluble in water.                                                                            |

## Similarities between lithium and magnesium

* Lithium shows similarities with magnesium due to their similar atomic and ionic radii.
* Both lithium and magnesium are harder and lighter than other elements in their respective groups.
* Lithium and magnesium react slowly with water.
* Their oxides and hydroxides are much less soluble in water.
* Their hydroxides decompose on heating. Other hydroxides of elements of group 1 and group 2 do not decompose on heating.

    $$LiOH + Heat &rarr; Li_2O + H_2O &uarr;$$

    $$Mg(OH)_2 + Heat &rarr; MgO + H_2O &uarr;$$

* Both lithium and magnesium form nitride by direct combination with N<sub>2</sub>.

    $$6Li + N_2 &rarr; 2Li_3N$$

    $$3Mg + N_2 &rarr; Mg_3N_2$$

* The oxides of Li<sub>2</sub>O and MgO do not combine with excess oxygen to give superoxide.
* The carbonates of lithium and magnesium decompose easily on heating to form oxides and CO<sub>2</sub>.

    $$Li_2CO_3 + Heat &rarr; Li_2O + CO_2$$

    $$MgCO_3 + Heat &rarr; MgO + CO_2$$

* Lithium and magnesium do not form **solid** hydrogen carbonates.
* Both LiCl and MgCl<sub>2</sub> are soluble in ethanol.
* Both LiCl and MgCl<sub>2</sub> are deliquescent and crystallize from aqueous solution as hydrates (Example: LiCl.2H<sub>2</sub>O, MgCl<sub>2</sub>.8H<sub>2</sub>O).
